## Description

Switch Tray is an Expert Advisor designed for customizable trading tray functionality. It allows traders to switch between different trading pairs with a single click, monitor open positions, and perform various trading functions.

The code provided in this repository demonstrates the core functionality of the Switch Tray Expert Advisor. It includes customization functions, open position display, quick switching, and trading functions such as placing orders, closing positions, and monitoring account balance.

## Customization Functions

The `CustomizeShortcutButtons()` function allows users to set their preferred trading pairs as shortcut buttons. Customization of the shortcut buttons can be done by adding the appropriate code within this function.

## Open Positions Display Function

The `DisplayOpenPositions()` function displays the number of open positions for each trading pair. It iterates through the tradingPairs array and prints the trading pair along with the corresponding number of open positions.

## Quick Switching Function

The `QuickSwitching(int index)` function allows traders to quickly switch between trading pairs with a single click. It takes an index as a parameter, representing the selected trading pair, and prints a message indicating the switch.

## Trading Functions for Switch Tray

The following trading functions are provided in this code:

- `PlaceOrder(double volume, ENUM_ORDER_TYPE orderType, string symbol)`: This function allows users to place orders for a specified trading pair. It takes the volume, order type, and symbol as parameters and prints a message indicating the order placement.

- `ClosePosition(string symbol)`: This function allows users to close positions for a specified trading pair. It takes the symbol as a parameter and prints a message indicating the position closure.

- `MonitorAccountBalance()`: This function monitors the account balance and prints a message indicating the monitoring process.

## Main Program Start

The `OnStart()` function is the entry point of the Expert Advisor. It executes the following steps:

1. Customization: Calls the `CustomizeShortcutButtons()` function to customize the shortcut buttons.

2. Open Positions Display: Calls the `DisplayOpenPositions()` function to display the number of open positions for each trading pair.

3. Quick Switching: Generates a random index using the `MathRand()` function and calls the `QuickSwitching(int index)` function to switch to the randomly selected trading pair.

4. Trading Functions: Calls the `PlaceOrder(double volume, ENUM_ORDER_TYPE orderType, string symbol)` function to place an order for the selected trading pair, then calls the `ClosePosition(string symbol)` function to close the position, and finally calls the `MonitorAccountBalance()` function to monitor the account balance.

Please note that this code is a sample implementation and may require additional customization or modification to fit specific trading strategies or requirements.
